## 2048
Old game, new tech. This implementation is made with Svelte (+SvelteKit), Typescript and Sass. 

## Todo
The current state of the application is pretty basic and it can be improved many ways:

 - UI elements (score counter, restart button, undo)
 - Fancy animations
 - Scoreboard (which means I have to bring the game logic to the backend in order to avoid cheating)


The app is deployed on Netlify:

If you experience any bugs or have an idea how could I improve it, don't hesitate to tell me.
